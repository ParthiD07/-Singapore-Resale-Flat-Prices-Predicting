# Singapore Resale Flat Prices Predicting

## Data Sources

The data used in this project will be sourced from publicly available datasets provided by Singapore government agencies such as the Housing and Development Board (HDB) and Data.gov.sg.

## Objectives

- Develop a Predictive Model: Create a robust machine learning model that can accurately predict the resale prices of flats based on historical transaction data.
- Deploy a User-Friendly Web Application: Implement the predictive model within a Streamlit-based web application to make it accessible and user-friendly for end-users.
- Assist Stakeholders: Provide valuable insights and predictions to potential buyers, sellers, real estate agents, and market analysts to help them make informed decisions.

## Scope
The project encompasses the following key steps:

- Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather and preprocess historical resale flat transaction data from reliable sources.
- Feature Engineering: Identify and engineer relevant features that significantly impact resale flat prices.
- Model Selection and Training: Evaluate different machine learning algorithms and select the most suitable model. Train the model using the preprocessed data.
- Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- Streamlit Web Application: Develop an interactive web application using Streamlit to deploy the predictive model.
- Deployment on Render: Host the web application on Render for public access.
- Testing and Validation: Rigorously test and validate the application to ensure it meets user needs and performs well in a real-world scenario.

## Technologies and Tools
The project will utilize the following technologies and tools:

- Programming Languages: Python
- Libraries and Frameworks: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit
